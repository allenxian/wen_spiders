# wen_spiders
## Introduction
Here are some spiders.  
All the spiders will inherit from the `BaseSpider` in `utils.base`, which implements many useful functions, such as automaticly switch the header of request, parse the content by `xpath`.    
I use `mongodb` as the default database and `redis` to control the parallel. You can find the setting in `config` on each folder.
